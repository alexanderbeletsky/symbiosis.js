## Contributing

### Issues

Try to be the most specific possible. Inform about version of node or browser and orm version. Give an example,
that will help other people to try and replicate your problem.

### Pull Requests

I'm very gratefull for pull requests, but they must pass all the tests. Also don't forget about adding
it to documentation (readme.md) and tests for new features, and add unit tests to verify a bug when fixing.
